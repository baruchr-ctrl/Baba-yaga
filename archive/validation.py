"""Validation rules for manuscript records.

YOU IMPLEMENT THIS FILE.

Every validate_* function takes a raw string (exactly as it came out of the
CSV file) and returns a tuple:

    (True, "")              the value is trustworthy
    (False, "reason here")  the value is not, and here is why

The reason is a short human-readable string. The autograder checks the
boolean, not your exact wording — but a teammate reading your rejection log
should understand it, so write it for them.

READ THIS BEFORE YOU START
--------------------------
The year range is INCLUSIVE at both ends: 1100 and 1900 are VALID.
1099 and 1901 are not. Most marks lost in Part A are lost on that line.
